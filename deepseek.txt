hello i want to build a warehouse system firstly i need the database schema and whether to use sql or no sql...   let me send you my requirments
System Users:
Administrator: Responsible for adding different types of goods hierarchy and the products in each hierarchy and their specs, and the system users (admins, managers, warehouse keepers), and the zero access system users [ (Assigned Users), Internal entities, suppliers (supplier type may be local country or worldwide or internal).]
Warehouse keeper: Responsible for entering and delivering goods with respect to the predefined processes.
Managers: have right to access some reports and search engine in the database.


Users 0 Access:
Assigned users: Those users donâ€™t have permission to access the system, but they are the only authorized to receive and/or fabricate products. When users get products as assigned users, the products should be known that are with this user now. And this user should belong to one or more internal entity over a specified duration.
Suppliers: info about them so we can relate products to them.
Internal Entities: info about it and the assigned users will have relation to it.

Work flow:
1st The Administrator will create the categories and subcategories of the products and the products it self and each product will have a unique product code.
The Administrator will add specs for each product.
 The Administrator will add/update/remove the supplierâ€™s info.
The Administrator will add/update/remove the entities and their info
The Administrator will add/update/remove the trusted users (users who can receive products from the warehouse) and since this user will represent an internal entity, it will have a represent duration start date and end date (end date may be present). And will add/update/remove warehouse keepers and this warehouse keeper will have start and end duration. And will add/update/remove Managers.
Those durations can be modified by the admin.

2TH The Warehouse keeper is the only authorized person responsible for entering goods and delivering goods from the warehouse. The warehouse keeper will manage the products movement in the system. 
Case 1: When a new product come to the warehouse the keeper will press on the add new product and will type the serial number and the reference number and the receive date. And from a drop-down menu predefined by the admin he will select which product he is adding and will select from which supplier he gets it. 
Case 2: if an assigned user returns a product. The warehouse keeper will search for its serial number and mark it as available again and will not be on the assigned user name now.
The assigned user can return many products as a new manufactured product this manufactured product will have a serial number. The warehouse keeper will enter this new manufactured product to the system by adding its serial number and receive date and reference number. And will select from drop down menu which is predefined by the admin the supplier (his type will be internal) and select which product is this. every product that was taken from the warehouse recently and used in the manufacturing of this new product will be marked as used in manufacturing that product and will not be available and will not be on the assigned username now.
Case 3: If this new manufactured product is decomposed then the warehouse keeper will then mark this product as decomposed and will not be available again! And the products used on it will reenter the system.

Case4: if a product is destroyed then it will be marked as destroyed and not available anymore.

Note: some items will not have a serial number even though the serial number is unique!
Note: The specs differ from a product to a product


3rd Mangers will View Products and receive reports.

i think even admin and warehouse_keeper and manager will represent and internal entity


Relationships Between Tables
Users and InternalEntities:

The UserEntities table links users to internal entities and tracks the duration of their representation.

Products and Categories:

The Products table links products to their categories, supporting a hierarchical structure.

Inventory and Products/Suppliers/Users:

The Inventory table tracks individual items, linking them to products, suppliers, and assigned users.

Manufactured Products:

The manufactured_product_id field in the Inventory table links a manufactured product to its components.

Certainly! Here's a summary of our conversation to help you continue seamlessly in a new chat without repeating everything:

Key Requirements
System Users:

Administrator: Manages categories, products, suppliers, internal entities, and users.

Warehouse Keeper: Handles product movements (receiving, assigning, returning, manufacturing, decomposing, destroying).

Managers: Access reports and search the database.

Assigned Users: Receive/fabricate products but have no system access. Products are tracked as being with them.

Workflow:

Admin creates categories, products, suppliers, and users.

Warehouse keeper manages product movements (receiving, assigning, returning, manufacturing, decomposing, destroying).

Managers view products and generate reports.

Product Tracking:

Products have unique codes and specifications.

Serial numbers are used for tracking (if available).

Products can be assigned, returned, used in manufacturing, decomposed, or destroyed.

Database Requirements:

Relational database (SQL recommended for structured data and complex queries).

Track product status, assigned users, manufacturing relationships, and dates (received, assigned, manufactured, decomposed, destroyed).

Final Database Schema
Your final schema includes the following tables:

Users:

Stores user information (admins, warehouse keepers, managers, assigned users).

Tracks roles, creation time, and user details.

Categories:

Manages hierarchical categories and subcategories.

Ensures unique category names under the same parent.

Products:

Stores product information, including unique codes and specifications.

Links products to categories.

Suppliers:

Stores supplier information (local, worldwide, internal).

Tracks supplier details and creation time.

Inventory:

Tracks product inventory, including serial numbers, status, and assigned users.

Links products to suppliers and tracks manufacturing relationships.

Includes dates for receiving, assigning, manufacturing, decomposing, and destroying products.

Uses a trigger to automatically update the updated_at column.

InternalEntities:

Stores information about internal entities.

UserEntities:

Links users to internal entities with a duration (start and end dates).

Ensures unique user-entity assignments.

Key Features
User Management:

Different roles with specific permissions.

Assigned users are tracked for product assignments.

Product Hierarchy:

Categories and subcategories for organizing products.

Inventory Tracking:

Tracks product status, serial numbers, and assigned users.

Handles manufacturing, decomposition, and destruction workflows.

Reporting:

Managers can generate reports on product assignments and movements.

Data Integrity:

Unique constraints on categories and user-entity assignments.

Foreign key constraints for relationships (e.g., products to categories, inventory to suppliers).

Next Steps
Implement the schema in your database.

Populate the tables with initial data (e.g., users, categories, products, suppliers).

Build workflows for:

Assigning products to users.

Returning products.

Manufacturing, decomposing, and destroying products.

Generate reports for managers.

Test the system thoroughly to ensure it meets all requirements.

The final schema is ready.

You need help with specific workflows, queries, or API design.

You want to test or optimize the system.
