Key Relationships
Products belong to Categories (hierarchical structure @lij@na@ya).

Inventory tracks individual items (with or without serial numbers) and their status.

AssignedUsers are linked to InternalEntities and can hold products.

Suppliers provide products, and their type (local, worldwide, internal) is tracked.

Inventory can reference itself for manufactured products (e.g., tracking components used in manufacturing).



Workflow Implementation
Adding Products:

The warehouse keeper selects a product from the dropdown (fetched from the Products table) and adds it to the Inventory table.

If the product is manufactured, the manufactured_product_id field links it to its components.

Returning Products:

The warehouse keeper updates the status field in the Inventory table (e.g., from assigned to available).

Manufacturing:

When a new product is manufactured, its components are marked as used_in_manufacturing in the Inventory table.

Decomposing/Destroying Products:

Update the status field to decomposed or destroyed.
